			You can create the CSV file in a spreadsheet and export it in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. The structure of the table is described below.

			<br/><br/>Each row of the file must contain data for the addition of hours to users. For the addition of hours, the following information must be included (in order):  username, total verified hours to be added, sponsored verified hours to be added.

			<br/><br/>Example:

			<br/><br/>jwashington, 23, 10
			<br/>bbaker, 20, 15.5
			<br/>2010rwu, 25, 6
			<br/>2010prandall, 30.25, 19

			<br/><br/>The above example will add hours to four students.  Note that these hours, because they are not linked to any event, will only apply to the current deadline.
			
			<br/><br/>The members for which the hours are being imported for must already be users in the NHS website. To import NHS members, navigate to "Users" and click on "Import Persons".
